# metadata.broker.list: a comma separated list of host:port entries.
# combinations of Kafka brokers you wish to procuce to, example:
# metadata.broker.list=r3k1.company.com:9092,r3k2.company.com:9092,r3k3.company.com:9092
# required: yes
#
metadata.broker.list=

# compression.codec: the compression codec you wish to use (gzip or snappy), example: 
# compression.codec=snappy
# required: yes
#
compression.codec=snappy

# queue.enqueue.timeout.ms: The amount of time to block
# before dropping messages when all buffers are full. If set to 0 
# events will be enqueued immediately or dropped if the queue is 
# full (the producer send call will never block). If set to -1 the
# producer will block indefinitely and never willingly drop a send.
# required: yes
#
queue.enqueue.timeout.ms=0

# use.shared.buffers (required): If this is set to true, then there 
# will be one set of buffers that is used by all Producer instances. 
# In that case, ensure that num.buffers is large enough.
# required: no
# default: false
#
use.shared.buffers=true

# kafka.rotate  Whether or not we rotate (round robin) through partitions on 
# each metadata refresh
# required: no
# default: false
#
kafka.rotate=true

# num.buffers: The number of buffers to use.  Set according to heap size.
# Recommendations are: 4GB=1000, 6GB=2000, 8GB=4000, 16GB=11000
# required: no
# default: 2
num.buffers=150

# kafka.key: a string that is hashed to determine the partion to procuce for.
# required: no
# default: the local hostname (warning--this may not hash evenly enough).
# example: kafka.key=!%*#@%$$^

#     sources has been deprecated in versions 0.7.0 and later and is now ignored
#
#
# sources: a comma separated list of topics klogger will receive messages for. (DEPRECATED--remove)

# source entries: the following source.<topic>.<port|file> entries are 
# used to specify topics and whether they are listened to on either a TCP
# port or a local file
#
# source.<topic>.port: the port to listen on for the specified topic
# source.<topic>.file: the file to listen on for the specified topic

# source.testingtopic.port=2001
